/*
intent: getCharacter
need: Axios 
Input human: character name - ${character} as parameter
get to api https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/${character}
don't forget to use .catch(err)
Tried to use different API, didn't work that well for me with the dates. 
In the end I chose to keep it simple so it will work.
